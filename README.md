## Instructions

You are required to write a pure JavaScript function called `highlightHTMLContent` that accepts three inputs and returns the expected result. Please follow the instructions below:

### Function Signature

```javascript
/**
 * Strips the prefix from the keys of the given key-value pairs
 * @param {string} htmlContent - HTML content which needs to be highlighted 
 * @param {string} plainText - This plain text is extracted from htmlContent
 * @param {array} plainTextPositions - Array of Objects with start and end positions of words in plainText (Not the positions in HTML)
 * @returns {string} Using the positions in plainText, find the appropriate positions in htmlContent, highlight the content and return it
 */
function highlightHTMLContent(htmlContent, plainText, plainTextPositions) {
  // your logic goes here
}
```

### Inputs

The `highlightHTMLContent` function should accept the following inputs:

- `htmlContent` (string): The HTML content that needs to be highlighted.

Example:

```


- `plainTextPositions` (array): An array of objects representing the start and end positions of words in `plainText`. Each object in the array should have the properties `start` and `end`.

Example:
```javascript
[
    {
        start: 241,
        end: 247,
    },
    {
        start: 518,
        end: 525,
    },
]
```

### Output

The function should find the appropriate positions in `htmlContent` based on the positions in `plainText`, highlight the content at those positions, and return the modified `htmlContent` as a string.

### Bonus

In addition to implementing the `highlightHTMLContent` function, you are encouraged to write unit tests using Jest. Aim to cover as many scenarios as possible to ensure the correctness of your solution.
